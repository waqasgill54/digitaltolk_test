Do at least ONE of the following tasks: refactor is mandatory. Write tests is optional, will be good bonus to see it. 
Please do not invest more than 2-4 hours on this.
Upload your results to a Github repo, for easier sharing and reviewing.

Thank you and good luck!



Code to refactor
=================
1) app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php
2) app/Repository/BookingRepository.php

Code to write tests (optional)
=====================
3) App/Helpers/TeHelper.php method willExpireAt
4) App/Repository/UserRepository.php, method createOrUpdate


----------------------------

What I expect in your repo:

X. A readme with:   Your thoughts about the code. What makes it amazing code. Or what makes it ok code. Or what makes it terrible code. How would you have done it. Thoughts on formatting, structure, logic.. The more details that you can provide about the code (what's terrible about it or/and what is good about it) the easier for us to assess your coding style, mentality etc

And 

Y.  Refactor it if you feel it needs refactoring. The more love you put into it. The easier for us to asses your thoughts, code principles etc


IMPORTANT: Make two commits. First commit with original code. Second with your refactor so we can easily trace changes. 


NB: you do not need to set up the code on local and make the web app run. It will not run as its not a complete web app. This is purely to assess you thoughts about code, formatting, logic etc


===== So expected output is a GitHub link with either =====

1. Readme described above (point X above) + refactored code 
OR
2. Readme described above (point X above) + refactored core + a unit test of the code that we have sent

Thank you!

I recently conducted a thorough review of our codebase, particularly focusing on the BookingController.php and BookingRepository.php file and its associated methods. I've identified several areas where we can enhance the code's readability, maintainability, and overall efficiency. Here's a summary of the key findings:

Separation of Concerns:
To improve modularity and readability, I suggest considering the separation of logic for preparing data into dedicated methods, especially within the updateJob method. This adjustment would contribute to a more modular codebase, making it easier to manage and understand.

Conditional Simplification:
Within the updateJob method, the conditions under the if ($job->due <= Carbon::now()) block can be simplified by combining the two separate if blocks. This not only streamlines the code but also improves its clarity.

Variable Naming:
Certain variable names, such as $changeTranslator and $changeDue in the updateJob method, could be more descriptive. Choosing meaningful names enhances code readability and makes it more self-explanatory.

Logging Enhancement:
Review the logging messages for clarity. Providing additional context or details in log messages, especially during changes or updates, can significantly improve the log's informational value.

Optimize Database Queries:
Consider optimizing database queries, particularly in the getAll method, by exploring the effective use of eager loading. This can help reduce the number of database queries and enhance performance.

Consistent Variable Naming:
Maintain consistency in variable naming conventions throughout the codebase, whether using camelCase or snake_case, to ensure a uniform and easily understandable code.

Reduce Code Redundancy:
In the changeStatus method, consider extracting common logic outside the switch statement to minimize redundancy and improve code maintainability.

Error Handling:
Implement proper error handling and validation checks, especially when interacting with database queries and user input, to enhance the code's robustness.

Avoid Unnecessary Operations:
Optimize the getAll method by reviewing and refining the logic, especially the conditional checks. Ensure that conditions are evaluated correctly and efficiently to avoid unnecessary operations.

Documentation:
Consider adding inline comments to explain complex or critical parts of the code. Comprehensive documentation will facilitate better understanding, not only for others but also for future reference.

I believe implementing these suggestions will contribute to a more robust and maintainable codebase.
